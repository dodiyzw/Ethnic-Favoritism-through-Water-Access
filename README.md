This project explores whether there are preferential access to water in Chad based on an individual's ethnic group. An ethnic match is defined as having the same ethnic group as the ruling president.
This project conducted a probit regression analysis to see if there individuals with an ethnic match has higher access to water.

## Limitation
The work of this project in terms of the availability of dataset. DHS only publishes data once every 10 years, and hence the variability within years are hard to track.
The ethnic composition in Chad is also complex, with some still practicing nomadic lifestyle. Hence, this makes drawing conclusion based on current available data difficult.
